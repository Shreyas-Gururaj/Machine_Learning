## Retrieving Wikipedia articles

This module focused on using nearest neighbors and clustering to retrieve documents that interest users, by analyzing their text. Explored two document representations: word counts and TF-IDF.  Used jupyter iPython notebook and necessary libraries for data transformation, visualization and retrieving articles from Wikipedia about famous people.

#### **Learning outcomes**

- Load and transform real, text data
- Compare results with word counts and TF-IDF
- Set the distance function in the retrieval
- Build a document retrieval model using nearest neighbor search

## Additional implementation

Used sklearn and pandas and supporting libraries to perform all the task.
