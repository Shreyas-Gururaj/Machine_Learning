## Analyzing product sentiment

This module focused on classifiers, applying them to analyzing product sentiment, and understanding the types of errors a classifier makes. Used jupyter iPython notebook and necessary libraries for data transformation, visualization analyzing the sentiment of real product reviews.

Trained a sentiment analysis model using a set of key polarizing words, verified the weights learned to each of these words, and compared the results of this simpler classifier with those of the one using all of the words.

#### Learning outcomes
##

- Transform real, text data
- Compare results of two models, one using all words and the other using a subset of the words
- Compare learned models with majority class prediction
- Examine the predictions of a sentiment model
- Build a sentiment analysis model using a classifier


## Additional implementation

Used sklearn and pandas and supporting libraries to perform all the task.
