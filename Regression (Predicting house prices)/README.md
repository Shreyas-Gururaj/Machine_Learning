## Predicting house prices

The module was focused on using regression to predict a continuous value (house prices) from features of the house (square feet of living space, number of bedrooms,...). Used jupyter iPython notebook and necessary libraries for data transformation, visualization and predicting house prices, using data from King County, USA, the region where the city of Seattle is located.

#### **Learning outcomes**

- Execute programs with the iPython notebook
- Load and transform real, tabular data
- Compute summaries and statistics of the data
- Build a regression model using features of the data


## Additional implementation

Used sklearn and pandas and supporting libraries to perform all the task.
