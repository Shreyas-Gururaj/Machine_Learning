## Deep features for image retrieval

This module focused on using deep learning to create non-linear features to improve the performance of machine learning. Transfer learning techniques can be applied to use deep features learned with one dataset to get great performance on a different dataset.Used jupyter iPython notebook and necessary libraries for data transformation, visualization and for both image retrieval and image classification tasks on real datasets.


#### Learning outcomes

- Use the .sketch_summary() method to view statistics of data
- Transform real, image data
- Build image retrieval models using nearest neighbor search and deep features
- Compare the results of various image retrieval models

## Additional implementation

Used sklearn and pandas and supporting libraries to perform all the task.
